	 	=> Factorial: product of positive integers less than or equal to given number
	 		(1*2*3*4*5=120)
	 		
	 	=> Factors: integers that divided number exactly without leaving a remainder

	 	=> Strong: sum of factorials of its digits equals the number itself
	 		(1!+4!+5!=145)
	 		
	 	=> Prime: it is a number greater than 1 that has only two factors [1 and itself]
	 		(2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...)
	 		
	 	=> Fibonacci: each number is the sum of the two preceding ones
