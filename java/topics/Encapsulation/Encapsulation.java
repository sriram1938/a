package Encapsulation;
/*
  
 
 => the concept of protecting object information 
 	in the process of communication.
 => we can implement encapsulation using [pojo] rules
 
 POJO : [playing old java object]
 
 1. class is public
 		hence the object is visible to other objects in 
 		communication process
 2. variables are private
  		hence are object can not access the information
  		of other object directly
 3. Every variable has setter & getter to share the 
 		information
 		
 public class Person
 {
 	private String name;
 	
 	public void setName(String name)
 	{
 		this.name=name;
 	}
 	
 	public String getName()
 	{
 		return this.name;
 	}
 }
